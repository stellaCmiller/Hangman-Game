# Hangman-Game

## Welcome to **desert theme** hangman! 

There are two javascript files that contain the logic for the game and are functionally identical to each other. The first
file, game.js, is coded procedurally and is the current one that is linked to on index.html. The second file, GameObject.js, 
is the entire game coded as an object with all of the same functions rewritten as methods to demonstrate OOP. 
**NOTE: This is still a work in progress and is not finished yet!**

### Features (6/21/18)

* The background desert pixel art is my own creation using the open source software GIMP. 
* Choose between three difficulty levels, each with their own word bank!
* Game automatically presents a new word after a win or lose

### Features coming soon

* Hints! Some of the words are difficult to guess ;)
* An on-screen keyboard with buttons so that mobile users can play without needing their phone keyboard to pop up
* More original pixel artwork and visual updates
